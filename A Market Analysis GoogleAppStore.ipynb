    "# A Market Analysis for App Store and Google Play\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to figure out profitable marketing personas and profiles for the App Store and Google Play digital stores. Marketing teams will use this information for their marketing efforts. We want to help our developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users on Google Play and the App Store. We're aiming for the English-speaking market for this analysis. Our primary source of revenue is in-app purchases and in-app ads. We're only looking for free to download apps. Therefore the number of users using the app is very important to us.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "In September 2018, both the App Store and Play Store had approximately 2 million apps available. The datasets we're using are from that time. Since four million rows are too big for our resources, we're using a sample of them dwindling them down to 10k rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can download the both [Google Play (data collected in August 2018)](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) and [App Store (data collected in July 2017)](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps) datasets for your use and examination using the links provided.\n",

    "## Our take on App Store\n",
    "\n",
    "We have ourselves a catch right here. References category has somewhat of an excellent distribution. You can argue this is as well a monopoly of some popular books in the form of religious texts and dictionaries. But religious text apps can be copied, and there can be lots of dictionaries for slangs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides those two big scopes of ideas, the market is full of life. There are references for games, pieces of music, there may be for technical fields and Wikia like pages for mangas and animes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Audiobooks and references for popular hits like Game of Thrones come to mind, Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter are only the other two pops up to mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "This general picture confirms as well our conception that the fun side of things dominates the App Store. The result is expected since we're continuing our analysis with the same dataset, however.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other genres that might be used to us are weather, book, drinks, and food.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weather apps are a possibility but must be very detailed and perhaps show historical data to keep users' interest high to achieve long app-use times. Weather apps, in most cases, are used in short bursts. People take a quick look at what the weather is going to be and turn the app off. So these shortcomings need some work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Food and drink apps are broad in scope. Having an actual delivery system won't work as it's a very competitive scene, and you can't just as quick startup from zero. Recipe apps can be fun, and people will spend time on them, especially with personalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, onto Google Play Store.\n",
    "\n",
    "Google Play dataset has installed columns, so we should be able to get a clearer picture of genre popularity. However, the install numbers don't seem precise enough -- we can see that most values are categorical."
